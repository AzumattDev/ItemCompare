| 1.0.4     | - Ability to see what uncooked items will turn into, and the stats of that item. <br/> - Compares un=crafted gear to equipped gear in the crafting menu, to see if you should even bother crafting it. (by comparing stats)<br/> - Add scrolling to the recipe description in case you don't have [RecipeDescriptionExpansion](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/Azumatt/Recipe_Description_Expansion/) installed<br/> - Key hold is no longer default to On, it's now off. People were saying they didn't know the mod was working with this default. That's now fixed, turn off if you want. |
| 1.0.3     | - Recompile for Ashlands. Remove stamina comparison for now until I get around to displaying all the new ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
